   <p class="caption" align="center">Born and raised in San Antonio, Texas, I go by KingRemer or simply Remer. I’m a multi-media artist specializing in spray paint, acrylics, markers, and mixed media across surfaces like canvas, paper, and large-scale walls. My focus lies in mural work and canvas-based creations, where I explore character design, anatomy, perspective, and expressive portraiture.

Art has always been a part of me—long before I had formal techniques, I was drawn to draw. My journey began with doodles in middle school, which led me into the world of graffiti. That culture not only gave me my first real recognition but also opened doors I never expected. In high school, I tried to transition into a more serious approach, but self-doubt and sensitivity to criticism caused me to step back for a time. After graduating, I came back with new energy, fueled by imagination and my love for the cartoons I grew up with.

Around five or six years ago, I began studying artists online and on social media, which reignited my passion and pushed me to dive deep into the technical side of art—especially anatomy and perspective. While I still have more to learn, it's my mission to keep improving for the sake of my craft, and to bring even more life to the characters and worlds I imagine.

My work blends graffiti influence, illustrative style, and a love for storytelling. I often create characters that feel like they’re from a far-off world—like something out of a role-playing game—offering viewers a break from reality. I also create large-scale portraits and letter-based productions, with murals being a core part of my practice. Seeing my work on the streets of my hometown is something that means the world to me. It’s a dream I used to only imagine as a kid, and now, it fuels my drive to keep growing and creating—to impress the younger version of me, and become the artist I once looked up to.</p> <br>
