   <p class="caption" align="center">Hello, my name is John Padron, I go by “KingRemer” or “Remer” normally.
I’m San Antonio based, born and raised here, and I’m a multi-media artist. I work with spray paint, acrylics, markers, brush’s, across different mediums, paper, canvas, walls. Canvas and murals have been my main production focus, while I continue to hone my skills with anatomy , perspective, and character design. 
All my life I’ve been an artist, from before I started to learn techniques, I was always drawn to draw. 
It’s something I haven’t lost till this day. Although I started at with doodles around middle school, i quickly got into graffiti which would really open up many spaces and opportunities down the line. Without the recognition I received through that avenue, I would have never come as far as I have. In high school I tried to transition into a more serious approach with art in a more professional way, judgment and criticism was something I was to sensitive to, and I stoped for a while. After high school I came back with a vengeance, and although I didn’t have much technical knowledge of drawing I drew purely out of the wonder of creativity. Drawing things in my imagination and replicating cartoons I grew up watching. About 5-6 years ago I sublet across many artist on social media and YouTube and it sparked a fire in me to really learn things in areas I disregard before. Anatomy and perspective. Although I still have much to learn, it’s my dream to continue perfecting and mastering these skills, for the benefit of my work. While also pursuing my love for creating letter productions, canvases, drawings, and most of all murals.

As a young creative many years ago seeing murals was something that always caught my eye, something I always wanted to do, but never knowing how. It’s  been a dream come true to drive around town and finally see work of mine here and there on walls. A younger me would be in disbelief. It’s my goal to continue impressing the younger me and being the creative I look up to.</p> <br>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <p>In my art I’ve tried to work a handful of different materials and mediums. Starting of with pen and pencil and paper, I work now also with acrylic paints, markers, digital media, and spray paint.
I tend to play with character design mostly. Bringing characters to life, from a world away from ours. Something like a role playing video game, I’ve always strived to take you away from reality to a place where characters I create exist. I also work with generally building my illustrative style with large portraits. </p>
